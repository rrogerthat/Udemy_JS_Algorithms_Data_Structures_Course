<h1>Udemy's Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass by Colt Steele</h1>

<p>This repository will progressively contain all my exercise solutions to the exercises given throughout the course in my 
determination to excel my understanding in CS fundamentals, namely Algorithms and Data Structures. Further, I hope to write
more efficient algorithms by factoring in time and space complexity.</p>

<h2>About the course:</h2>
<p>The Missing Computer Science and Coding Interview Bootcamp</p>
<blockquote>I start by teaching you how to analyze your codeâ€™s time and space complexity using Big O notation.  
We cover the ins and outs of Recursion.  We learn a 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem. 
We cover common programming patterns. We implement popular searching algorithms. We write 6 different sorting algorithms: 
Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort.   Then, we switch gears and implement our own data structures 
from scratch, including linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.  We learn to traverse trees and graphs, 
and cover Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.  The course also includes an entire section devoted to Dynamic Programming.</blockquote>
